# TinyApp Project

TinyApp is a full stack web application built with Node and Express that allows users to shorten long URLs (Ã  la bit.ly).

This app will allow user to register and then shorten the url that they enter. Without registering you will not be able to see or edit or delete other urls.

As a user you also have the ability to edit or delete your shortened url.

As shown in the image above, this will be the registered users home page. Users are able to edit or delete their urls at any given time.

Clicking on "Create New URL" will bring you to this page (as shown in the image above). This is where users can type in a url of their choice. Clicking on the SUBMIT button will generate a tiny url for the entered url.
